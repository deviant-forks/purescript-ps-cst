# purescript-ps-ast

Currently this package provides an opinionated AST for PureScript which was ripped from purescript-react-basic-mui codegen tool. We hope to turn it into somethig more generic and complete.

TODO:

- use https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-optparse/3.0.0/docs/Text.PrettyPrint.Leijen instead of Boxes
